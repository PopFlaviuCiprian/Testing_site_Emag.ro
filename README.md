- In this mini project we are testing an ecommerce platform https://www.emag.ro
- We test the folowing things, we search a product, we check the title of the new page returned, we select the first product in the list and add to chart, then we select the second product from the list and add it to chart and then we go to check the chart and return to home page
- I added the test in a suite and generate an html report.

- We have to install:
- pip install selenium
- pip install unittest
- pip install webdriver-manager
- pip install html-testRunner
